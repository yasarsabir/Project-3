# PROJECT 3 - COVID-19 DATA

This project was conducted by B Ojimah, Z Karim, I Nira, Y Sabir & S Boateng

The aim of this project was to answer the following questions utilising different types of visualisation techniques including Flask App, Leaflet and Plotly:
- Covid-19 vaccines administered in chosen countries over a set period of time
- The relationship between COVID-19 Cases and GDP in the chosen countries
- The relationship between COVID-19 Spread and vaccination percentages in chosen countries
- The relationship between stringency indexes and COVID-19 spread.

The charts and visualisations used to answer the above can be found in the COVID-19 data project PowerPoint.


We used plotly to create interactive charts
We used FLASK to create a dashboard and multiple routes
We used leaflet to create maps for visual display and used a novel leaflet plugin to create a credit conntrol on our map. We also used multiple tile layers and layer control as well including a interactive dropdown menu and zoomin/flyto function for better user experience.
